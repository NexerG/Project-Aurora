# ROADMAP
Phases, dates and standing decisions live in [[Roadmap]]. Items below are grouped by phase; video/content work and research are separate sections at the bottom.

---
# PHASE A — Periodic MVP + engine hygiene (now → ~Jul 2026)
- [ ] Headless test project — wire `AuroraTesting` into the solution + a test framework so engine logic can be tested without booting the GPU/window (e.g. `RichTextDocument` XML round-trip, editor edit ops). Currently empty/not in solution; editor work is manually GUI-verified until this exists.
- [ ] UI collision
	- [ ] add handle states - game, ui etc
	- [ ] Update engine class so the mouse inputs are handled in input handler
- [ ] text editor
	- [ ] fix beziers
	- [ ] turn msdf into mtsdf
	- [ ] add the rest of the alphabet (eu languages)
		- [ ] create language packs?
	- [ ] editor
		- [ ] Markdown insertions
		- [ ] L1 — layout engine (pageless): `TextMeasurer` + per-block line cache + prefix-summed block tops; all geometry (incl. mouse hit-testing) resolves on the cache
		- [ ] L2 — virtualized view: materialize only visible blocks ± 1 viewport, `TextRunControl`, glyph GPU cleanup + pooling (the `TextControl` deferred-cleanup TODOs)
		- [ ] L3 — page system (paginator over cached lines + page chrome; pageless is the L1 default mode)
		- [ ] code blocks (B1 — monospace, no wrap, view-time syntax coloring)
		- [ ] custom expressions (maths)
	- [ ] Project browser
	- [ ] Claude, chatgpt, other chatbot integrations.
	- [ ] text upgrade
		- [ ] simple color
		- [ ] gradient
		- [ ] bold/italics
		- [ ] horizontal lines (honestly its just a panel)
		- [ ] tables
	- [ ] cursor change on context
- [ ] UI
	- [ ] fix up UI shaders (samplers, transparency)
	- [ ] checkout `Pretext` by Cheng Lou for UI layout calculations (apparently 500x faster than the current implementation)	
	- [x] Stack panel
	- [x] Grid
		- [x] update grid logic
		- [x] add gaps in between grid cells
		- [x] only one item per grid cell
	- [x] Scroll
	- [x] UI "start" scaler with multipliers
	- [ ] fix action xsd attribute bcz it dont find actions if theyre not named EXACTLY the same (action - attribute)
- [ ] fix resolution stuff associated with DPI and stuff. use `glfwGetMonitorContentScale` *(non-essential)*

---
# PHASE B — ECS rework + renderer/settings foundation (~Jul–Sep 2026)
- [ ] ECS rework — object lists → data-oriented struct components, designed determinism/snapshot-friendly for later netcode
- [ ] renderer foundation
	- [ ] framebuffer removal
	- [ ] `vk_khr_dynamic_rendering` - removes render pass and framebuffer.
	- [ ] figure out why the renderer breaks the second monitor
- [ ] Engine settings/preferences — XSD/XML-driven (GPU device selection, CPU/thread counts, misc engine options)
	- [ ] Settings (some day) *(graduated from the Registry/Bootstrapper rework item)*
- [ ] figure out a way to do UITrees (save only tree tops in the registry)
- [ ] update logging with .NET 11 *(non-essential)*

---
# PHASE C — Animation core + AuroraMotion (~Sep–Dec 2026)
- [ ] Animation/evaluation core — keyframes + curves (reuse bezier math), property tracks bound to ECS component fields via `[A_XSDElementProperty]` + stable IDs, clips, evaluation clock; the foundation procedural ops plug into
- [ ] Procedural geometry/SDF evaluation — XML-declared operation chain (XSD types as ops) driven by the evaluation core; geometry-nodes-like workflow without a node-graph UI
	- [ ] XML material directed acyclic graph (DAG) *(shares design with the procedural op chain)*
- [ ] XML scene format — finish scene load/save as XSD/XML; binary `Serializer` stays for blobs only
- [ ] Offscreen rendering + readback — fixed-timestep render to image + GPU→CPU copy
- [ ] Video export — pipe raw frames to external `ffmpeg.exe` via stdin; codec presets for H.264/mp4, VP9, AV1
- [ ] Simple audio layer — load + play audio files, mux audio tracks into exports via ffmpeg (no mixing/spatialization engine yet)
- [ ] Timeline UI — timeline/dopesheet control built from existing containers
	- [ ] Window Splitter
- [ ] `AuroraMotion` host project (same pattern as `Periodic`: thin app over the engine)

---
# PHASE D — Editor shell + renderer maturity (2027)
- [ ] AuroraEditor shell — scene hierarchy panel, reflection-driven inspector (off XSD attributes), asset browser
- [ ] Registry and Bootstrapper rework
- [ ] renderer update
	- [ ] separate whole renderer features away from modules like `TimelineSemaphores` into an array. (settings)
	- [ ] resource manager
	- [ ] Buffer device address (BDA) for vertex buffers
	- [ ] descriptor sets
		- [ ] create global descriptor set (time, settings, etc)
		- [ ] texture set
			- [ ] massive texture buffer
		- [ ] sampler set
		- [ ] per object data
	- [ ] bring mesh component up to speed with the new system
	- [ ] try to add normal rasterizer to the new renderer ecosystem 
	- [ ] figure out how to blend the game render and UI render
	- [ ] fix normal rasterizer
	- [ ] Lazy renderer
		- [ ] draw only if the renderer was marked dirty
	- [ ] separate queue allocation
		- [ ] fix
		   `destinationStage = PipelineStageFlags.AllCommandsBit;`
		   to
		   `destinationStage = PipelineStageFlags.FragmentShaderBit;`
		   this fix will need to move texture assigning on the graphics queue instead of the transfer queue.
	- [ ] Vulkan module upgrade
		- [ ] figure out how to do GPU occlusion culling
			- [ ] after buffered descriptor sets
			- [ ] compute shaders. this CAN create a few independent simultaneously executing branches
		- [ ] try to figure out a way to better differentiate between renderer types (compute, ray trace, raster).
		- [ ] shared resources
		- [ ] research making shader resources cache friendly
	- [ ] update command buffers. Have one persistent one and copy it over to the others instead of updating every one each time before a new frame
- [ ] Render graph upgrade *(non-essential)*
	- [ ] garbage collector
- [ ] Renderer upgrade *(non-essential)*
	- [ ] LODs. First person/ non fps mesh details

---
# PHASE E — Physics + audio engine + gameplay foundation (2027–2028)
- [ ] AVBD physics engine — broadphase, narrowphase, solver; real physics thread replaces the 32 ms sleep stub
	- [ ] benchmark vs Jolt (JoltPhysicsSharp as dev/test-only dependency — comparison harness, not shipped)
- [ ] Character controller + ballistics raycasts
- [ ] Audio engine — mixing, 3D spatialization, occlusion; upgrades the Phase C playback layer in place

---
# PHASE F — The game (2028–2030)
- [ ] World streaming
- [ ] Procedural:
	- [ ] land generation
	- [ ] prop placement
- [ ] Decal placement

- [ ] Inventory/stash UI
- [ ] Netcode on the snapshot-ready ECS (~year 3)
