# Decision — a planner is one vault file with three views; the calendar is merged into it

**Date:** 2026-10-07
**Scope:** `ArctisAurora.Core.UI` — `PlannerDocument`, `PlannerCategory`, `PlannerTicket`, `TimeRange`, `PlannerXml`, `GanttChartControl`, `PlannerBoardControl`, `PlannerEditorControl`, `PlannerZoom`, `PlannerView`, `PlannerTicketPopup`, `PlannerActions`, `PlannerTicketEdit`, `PlannerTicketAddEdit`, `PlannerCategoryPopup`, `PlannerCategoryEdit`, `PlannerCategoryAddEdit`, `CalendarControl`, `CalendarSpan`, `PlannerAttachment`, `PlannerAttachmentKind`, `PlannerAttachmentKindMap`, `PlannerAttachmentKinds`; `ArctisAurora.Core.Users` — `User`; `Thorium.Editor.CustomControls.VaultBrowserControl` (`BuildPlannerTab`, `NewPlanner`, `CreatePlanner`, `BuildTab`, `Extension`, `BaseName`, `VaultNotes`); data `Engine.attachments.xml`; suite `Planner.tests.xml`

## What changed
- New vault file kind `*.planner.xml`: categories and the tickets filed under them. Phases F0 + P1 of [[planner-plan]] landed read-only; P2 (Gantt editing), P3 (board drag), P4 (categories, assignee chips), PC (calendar view) and C2 (attachments, links) landed 2026-10-07 — see the P2, P3, P4, PC and C2 sections below.
- `PlannerDocument` — `extension`, `defaultColor` (`#4C8BF5`), `name`, `categories`, `tickets`, `extra` (unknown elements kept), `undo` (used from P2), `IsPlanner`, `Load`, `Save`, `Blank(name)` (one category "General"), `CategoryOf` (missing category → first), `ColorOf` (ticket colour, else category colour), `TicketsIn(category)` (by `order`, then start).
- `PlannerCategory` (`id` Guid, `name`, `colorHex`); `PlannerTicket` (`id` Guid, `name`, `categoryId`, `colorHex?`, `time`, `creator`, `created`, `assignees`, `order` = position in its board column, `extra`).
- `TimeRange` — `readonly record struct (start, end, allDay, timeZone)`; wall-clock start, **exclusive** end; all-day runs midnight to midnight; `Days(first, last)`. `timeZone` is stored and round-tripped, never converted.
- `PlannerXml` (`Load`, `Save`, `Parse`, `ToXml`): `<Planner Name><Category Id Name Color/><Ticket Id Name Category Color Start End AllDay TimeZone Creator Created Order><Assignee User/></Ticket></Planner>`. All-day Start/End `yyyy-MM-dd`, timed `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm`, Created ISO "s". A ticket without readable Start/End is kept as an unknown element; no categories → "General" added; written order categories, tickets, unknown.
- `GanttChartControl` (built like `SheetControl`): `PlannerZoom { Hour, Day, Week, Month }` (day widths 768 / 32 / 10 / 3 px), `nameWidth` 200, `bandHeight` 22, `headerHeight` 44, `rowHeight` 28; span = every ticket and today, padded 4 units (6 at Hour); rows = each category (shaded) then its tickets; only rows/units in the viewport get pooled `ChartParts`; name column pinned left, two-band date header pinned top, weeks start Monday, today line in Accent. Geometry: `Offset`, `X`, `TimeAt`, `RowTop`, `RowOf`, `BarRect`, internal `RowsChanged`.
- `PlannerBoardControl` (horizontal StackPanel): `columnWidth` 260, internal `Rebuild()`, static `Dates(TimeRange)`; a column per category (swatch + "Name  count"), cards with a colour strip on top, name, dates, "by <creator>".
- `PlannerEditorControl` (`IFileEditor`): `PlannerView { Gantt, Board, Calendar }`; toolbar Gantt | Board | Calendar left, Hour/Day/Week/Month right (Gantt only); `SetZoom` keeps the time at the viewport's left edge; `ViewState`/`RestoreView` put the view in `SessionTab.topBlock`, zoom in `caretBlock`, scroll in `scrollX`/`topDelta`. Private nested `PlannerScroller`.
- `ArctisAurora.Core.Users.User`: `name`, static `current` = `new User("Grexen")`, `Named(string)`, equality by name. Hard-coded on the user's instruction.
- Thorium: actions `Planners.New`, `Planners.NewHere`; `BuildTab` routes `*.planner.xml`; `Extension`/`BaseName` treat ".planner.xml" as one extension; `VaultNotes()` skips planners. "New planner" in `File.menu.xml`, `Vault.menu.xml`, `VaultFolder.menu.xml`.
- Tests: `Planner.XmlRoundTrip`, `Planner.GanttGeometry`, `Planner.BoardColumns`, `Planner.ViewState`.

## Why these choices

**One file, three views — the calendar is merged into the planner.**
A planner ticket is the event, and the calendar's Day/Week/Month view becomes a third planner view (phase PC). Rejected: a separate `*.calendar.xml` file kind plus an `ITimedItem` interface so a calendar view could sit over both — two file kinds and an abstraction for what the user wants as one document. `CalendarDocument`, `CalendarEvent` and `CalendarEditorControl` are dropped. Google/iCloud sync stays out and stays parked in [[calendar-plan]].

**The extension is `*.planner.xml`.**
The user's pick over `*.gantt.xml` and `*.board.xml`, because one file holds both views.

**Board columns are the categories.**
The user's pick; moving a card between columns will change its category (P3). Rejected: Trello-style status columns (To do / Doing / Done) with category as a colour label — one more field and its own column list.

**Times are date + time, not whole days.**
The planner is heading toward calendar use, so `TimeRange` carries wall-clock times and the Gantt has an Hour zoom. Drags (P2) will snap to the hour on Hour zoom, the day otherwise. End is exclusive, matching iCalendar's DTEND.

**The creator is a `User` class, hand-set to "Grexen".**
No accounts, no settings field. Stored in XML by name. Assignees are `User`s too, stored as `<Assignee User/>`; the assignee feature was a stub until P4, which shows initials chips on board cards.

**Ids are Guids.**
Category and ticket ids are Guids so a rename does not break a reference.

**The board is read-only in P1, not deferred.**
A read-only board is P3's display part pulled forward so the Gantt/Board switch has something to switch to.

**The board card's colour strip runs across the top.**
In a horizontal `StackPanelControl` a child with no preferred height fills the cross axis, so a side strip with no height measured unbounded and stretched the first card to the column's full height, hiding the rest. Seen in a shot, then fixed.

**No `PlannerBook`.**
Sheets have `SheetBook` to share one loaded copy across tabs, for formulas; not needed yet.

## Known gaps
- (P1 state) Nothing was editable; P2 made the Gantt editable. The board is still read-only (P3).
- (P1 state) No goldens: the today line and the span move with the clock. P2 added `PlannerEditorControl.clock` and the golden `Planner.GanttGolden`.
- `timeZone` is round-tripped only, never applied.
- The Gantt chart is narrower than the viewport when the span is short (the grid stops at the span end).
- **Verified:** test-verified (`bash _Build/test.sh Planner` → 4 passed; full run 225 passed, 3 failed — Boot on the baseline sampler error, `Sheet.FixedSize` already in the WIP list, `Perf.TypeLargeNote` on the baseline `[Layout] skipped layout … desired stale` errors; no `[Vulkan]` lines) and shot-verified (a throwaway golden, since deleted, showed the Gantt at Day and Week zoom and the board with 3 categories / 6 tickets).
- **Not GUI-verified:** "New planner" from the File / vault / folder menus, opening, renaming, duplicating and deleting a planner in the vault browser, tab restore across a restart, scrolling and the zoom buttons in a running Thorium. No test drives the vault browser.

## P2 — Gantt editing (landed 2026-10-07)

### What changed
- Gantt editing: click a bar to select it (outlined in Ink); drag the middle to move, an edge to resize; double-click edits; "+ Ticket" opens the ticket popup for a new ticket; Delete removes the selected ticket; Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z undo / redo; Ctrl+S saves; right-click offers Edit ticket, Delete ticket and a "Move to category" submenu listing the planner's categories.
- Engine, `ContextMenus`: `OpenFrom(entries, on, point, width = 0, centered = false)` opens a menu from inside an open popup without closing it; `RegisterSource(name, build)` + `ContextMenuSubmenu.source` build a submenu's entries when it opens. Details in [[context-menus]] (section "Menus inside popups and submenus built on open"). `DropdownControl.OnPointerRelease` now calls `OpenFrom`.
- `PlannerDocument`: `changed` event + `Changed()`, `NextOrder(category)` (order that puts a ticket last in a category). `PlannerTicket`: `Clone()`, `CopyFrom(other)`.
- `PlannerEdits.cs`: `PlannerTicketEdit(document, ticket, before, after)` (copies before/after over the live ticket, raises `Changed`), `PlannerTicketAddEdit(document, ticket, index, add)` (insert at index / remove).
- `PlannerEditorControl`: `undo`, `selected`, `clock` (`Func<DateTime>`, default `DateTime.Now`) and `Now`, `Select`, `AddTicket`, `EditSelected`, `MoveSelected(category)`, `DeleteSelected`, `Apply(ticket?, draft)` (edit → one "Edit ticket" step; null ticket → "Add ticket", the draft becomes the ticket and is selected), internal `CommitTime(ticket, before, label)`, `Undo`, `Redo`, private `Record(label, edit)` (Begin scope, Redo, Push — same as `SheetEditorControl.Record`), private `DocumentChanged` (sets `unsaved`, drops a deleted selection, redraws chart/board), `OnDestroy` unsubscribes. Toolbar gains "+ Ticket".
- `GanttChartControl`: `contextMenu = "planner"`; static ctor registers source `"planner-categories"` (one button per category of the planner found by walking up from `ContextMenus.target`, action `MoveSelected`; empty when nothing is selected); selection outline (4 Ink parts, `outlineWidth` 2); public `TicketAt(point)`, private `GripAt` (edge zone = min(6 px, bar width / 3) inside, 6 px outside → resize; middle → move), `OnPointerPress` (left: select + `StartDrag` on a bar; right: select the row's ticket, return false so the menu opens), `OnDrag` (snaps the delta: hour on Hour zoom for a timed ticket, day otherwise; resize keeps at least one unit), `OnDragStop` (one "Move ticket" / "Resize ticket" step through `CommitTime`), `OnPointerMove`/`OnPointerExit` (HResize cursor on edges), `OnPointerTap` (double → edit). Today line and span use `editor.Now`.
- `PlannerTicketPopup.cs` (internal, built like `SheetGrowPopup`): Name, Category (`DropdownControl`, SubField), Start, End (`yyyy-MM-dd` for all-day, end shown as the last day; `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` timed; two dates → all-day, a time in either → timed; unreadable box keeps its value; end ≤ start → +1 day / +1 hour), Assignees (comma-separated → `User.Named`), Colour (`ColorPickerControl`), "Created by", an Apply button. Enter in any box or Apply = one step; Esc / outside click cancels. New ticket: "New ticket", today all day, `User.current`, created = `editor.Now`, last in the selected ticket's category (else the first). Changing category re-orders it last in the new one.
- `PlannerActions.cs`: `Planner.Undo`, `Planner.Redo`, `Planner.Delete`, `Planner.Edit`, `Planner.Save` ("Input" actions; no-op unless a planner holds the active control).
- Thorium data: `Planner.menu.xml` (Edit ticket → `Planner.Edit`, Delete ticket → `Planner.Delete`, `<ContextSubmenu Text="Move to category" Source="planner-categories"/>`), registered as `planner` in `ThoriumAssets.assets.xml`; `InputMap.inputs.xml`: Delete → `Planner.Delete`, Ctrl+Z → `Planner.Undo`, Ctrl+Y and Ctrl+Shift+Z → `Planner.Redo`, Ctrl+S → `Planner.Save` (second binds beside the `Sheet.*` / `Text.*` ones).
- Tests: Thorium `Planner.DragMoveUndo`, `Planner.DragResize`, `Planner.EditAddDelete`, `Planner.DeleteKeys`, `Planner.SaveKey`, `Planner.PopupCategory`, `Planner.MenuMove`, `Planner.GanttGolden` (golden `Planner.GanttGolden.Day.png`, clock pinned to 2026-10-06 12:00); engine Input suite `Input.DropdownInsidePopup`, `Input.SourceSubmenu`.

### Why
**Nested menus in the engine (user's pick).**
A `DropdownControl` inside a `ContextMenus` popup used to close the popup, because `ContextMenus.Open` closes whatever is open first. Rejected: category chips in the popup (works today, no engine change, but the user wanted the general fix); making the ticket editor a dialog window (a second hosting path for one popup).

**Submenus built on open (user's pick: "gets stuff on open … or registered at runtime then get'ed").**
`RegisterSource` is both: a builder registered at runtime, called each time the submenu opens. Rejected: a registered list the planner keeps updated — stale when two open planners have different categories. Rejected: the chart building its whole right-click menu in code — loses the XML menu.

**One undo step per gesture.**
A drag mutates the ticket live and records one `PlannerTicketEdit` at `OnDragStop` (before = clone at press), the same shape as `SheetBandEdit` recorded in `OnDragStop`. The popup applies all fields as one step.

**Snapping snaps the delta, not the edge.**
A timed ticket moved on Day zoom keeps its time of day; hour only on Hour zoom for timed tickets.

**Edit records copy whole tickets** (`Clone`/`CopyFrom`) rather than per-field records — a ticket is a dozen fields; one record type covers drag, popup and Move to category.

**`PlannerDocument.changed`** is the planner's equivalent of `SheetBook.changed`, per document because there is no `PlannerBook` (one editor per document).

**`clock` on the editor** pins "now" so the Gantt golden does not move with the date.

**Ctrl+S and the Apply button were added at the user's request.**
Apply because a press on the colour picker moves focus off the text boxes and Enter in the picker's hex box only commits the colour.

Category is picked by name in the popup: two categories with the same name resolve to the first.

### Known gaps
- No Tab between popup boxes (no `Planner.Tab` bind); the popup's caption labels are centred in their 90 px column.
- A ticket's own colour cannot be cleared back to the category colour once picked.
- Dragging a bar past the chart's span is cut off until release (span rebuilds on `Changed`).
- No vertical drag between categories on the Gantt (the board drags cards between categories since P3).
- `PlannerCategoryEdit` moved to P4 (nothing edits categories yet).
- (P2 state) Board view still read-only; P3 made it draggable.
- Other hosts' generated schemas (`UITypeSchema.xsd` etc. under AuroraEditor/Carbon) regenerate with the new `Source` attribute on their next run.
- **Verified:** test-verified (`bash _Build/test.sh Planner` → 12 passed; `bash _Build/test.sh Input` → 6 passed, Boot fails only on the baseline sampler error; full run 235 passed, 3 failed — Boot (baseline), `Sheet.FixedSize` (pre-existing), `Perf.TypeLargeNote` (baseline `[Layout] skipped layout` error kinds); no `[Vulkan]` lines). golden-verified: `Planner.GanttGolden` (Day zoom, selection outline, pinned today line), approved after reading the PNG. shot-verified: a throwaway shot (deleted) showed the ticket popup with its category list open over it, popup still open.
- **Not GUI-verified:** dragging bars with a real mouse (cursor shape, feel of snapping), the popup in a running Thorium (typing dates, colour picker, Apply), right-click menu and Move to category submenu, Ctrl+S / Ctrl+Z / Delete in a real session, and the Settings window / note-properties dropdowns after the `OpenFrom` switch (they should be unchanged).

## P3 — board drag (landed 2026-10-07)

### What changed
- The board is interactive. A card pressed and moved 4 px starts a drag (with the `DragGhost` preview, like a tab); while it is over the board the target column is outlined in Accent and a gap opens where the card will land; dropping files the ticket under that column's category at that place, renumbering the column, as one undo step.
- `PlannerBoardControl`: new public nested `TicketCard : StackPanelControl` (`board`, `ticket`; arms on a left press, claims the drag past `dragThreshold` 4 px with `StartDrag` + `DragGhost.Show`, `OnDragStop` → `DragGhost.Hide`) — the same claim-past-threshold shape as `TabStripButtonControl`. New private `columns` list (category, column panel, cards) built by `Rebuild`; public `CardsIn(category)`; private static `Fill(card, document, ticket)` replaces the old static `Card(...)` builder.
- `PlannerBoardControl` region `drop`: private `DropAt(dragged, point, out column, out index)` (the column whose x-range holds the point, else the nearest; index = the column's other cards whose centre is above the point; only a `TicketCard` of this board), `DraggingOverStart`/`DraggingOver` → `Mark`, `DraggingOverEnd` → `Unmark`, `FinishDrag` → `editor.MoveTicket(ticket, category, index)` (P3 posted it with `Engine.Post`; P4 removed that, the board rebuild is posted instead — see "P4").
- Marker: target column `edgeRole = Accent`, `edgeThickness` 1.5 px (`markWidth` 3 × 0.5); a `dropGap` 28 px top margin on the card the drop lands before, or bottom margin on the last card when it lands last; `markedColumn`/`markedCard`/`markedIndex`, reset by `Unmark` and `Rebuild`.
- `PlannerEditorControl.MoveTicket(ticket, category, index)` (new): builds the target column without the ticket, inserts it at `index` (clamped), and records one "Move ticket" step changing `order` (0..n) and `categoryId` of every ticket whose value differs. The source column is not renumbered (gaps in `order` are harmless).
- `PlannerTicketEdit` now holds a list of (ticket, before, after); new constructor `PlannerTicketEdit(document, List<(ticket, before, after)>)`; the single-ticket constructor delegates to it. Undo/Redo copy every entry, then raise `Changed` once.
- Tests (Thorium Planner suite): `Planner.BoardDragAcross`, `Planner.BoardDragWithin`, `Planner.BoardGolden` (goldens `Planner.BoardGolden.Board.png` and `Planner.BoardGolden.Marker.png` — the Marker shot drives `board.DraggingOver` directly).

### Why
**Engine drag-and-drop, not a self-contained drag in the board.**
Cards are drag claimants and the board is the drop target through `DraggingOver*`/`FinishDrag`, as tabs do; this gets `DragGhost` and the hit-test that skips the dragged subtree for free. Rejected: the board dragging a fake card itself (like `GanttChartControl` drags bars) — re-implements the preview and hit-testing.

**A gap marker, not a line.**
First tried an Accent edge on the card the drop lands before: invisible, because the card's colour strip child draws over its top edge (seen in the golden shot). There is no insert-at-index child API, so a marker child was not an option without reshaping the board. A margin gap on the neighbouring card opens the space where the card will land (Trello-like) and is stable under the pointer: the card the gap pushes down moves away from the pointer, so the index does not flip back.

**Renumber the target column in one record.**
Inserting between neighbours with integer `order` needs renumbering; a list-carrying `PlannerTicketEdit` keeps it one record and raises `Changed` once (per-ticket records would rebuild the board once per ticket). Rejected: fractional/spaced orders.

**Superseded in P4 — the drop was applied one tick later (`Engine.Post`) in `FinishDrag`.**
Applying it inside `FinishDrag` rebuilds the board, which destroys the dragged card while `UIEngine.EndDrag` is still running (it calls `OnDragStop` on it afterwards). That left stale layout state: a later, unrelated test (`Perf.Controls.Scrollable.Relayout`, run after the Planner suite in the full `--test` run) logged `[UIEngine] 'entity' subtreeBounds (0, 0, 0, 0) != recomputed …` ×4 and `[Layout] skipped layout left … subtreeBounds stale` ×4 and failed. Bisected: removing the two board-drag tests cleared it; removing `DragGhost.Show` did not; deferring the move did. The root cause in the engine (destroying the drag claimant inside `FinishDrag`) is not fixed. P4 widened the finding and moved the fix to the source: `FinishDrag` calls `MoveTicket` directly and the board rebuild itself is posted (`RebuildSoon`). See [[rebuild-inside-pointer-dispatch]].

`PlannerCategoryEdit` stays in P4.

### Known gaps
- Cards cannot be selected or opened from the board (no click-to-select, no double-click to edit; Delete / Edit act on the Gantt selection only).
- A drop outside the board does nothing (the card stays); no auto-scroll while dragging near the board's edge.
- The engine trap above is unguarded; P4 widened it to destroying controls inside any `UIEngine` pointer dispatch.
- **Verified:** test-verified (Planner suite 15 passed, Boot fails only on the baseline sampler error; full run 238 passed, 3 failed — Boot (baseline), `Sheet.FixedSize` (pre-existing), `Perf.TypeLargeNote` (baseline `[Layout] skipped layout … desired stale` kinds); no `[Vulkan]` lines). golden-verified: `Planner.BoardGolden` Board and Marker shots, approved after reading both PNGs (column outline + gap above the card).
- **Not GUI-verified:** a real mouse drag of a card (ghost preview, marker following the pointer, drop), dragging off the board or into another window, drag feel with many cards.

## P4 — categories and assignee chips (landed 2026-10-07)

### What changed
- Categories can be added, renamed, recoloured and deleted, each one undo step; board cards show assignee initials as chips. The board now rebuilds one tick after a change (posted), which replaced P3's per-call deferral of the drop and fixes the same layout-state bug on every path.
- `ArctisAurora.Core.Users.User.initials` (new property): first letters of the first two words, else the first two letters of a one-word name, upper-cased ("Grexen" → "GR", "Ada Lovelace" → "AL"; empty → "?").
- `PlannerEdits.cs`: new `PlannerCategoryEdit(document, category, (name, colorHex) before, (name, colorHex) after)`; new `PlannerCategoryAddEdit(document, category, index, add)` (insert at index / remove; raises `Changed`).
- `PlannerEditorControl`: `pickedCategory` + private `pickedFrom`/`pickedAt` (the category last pressed on and where); `PickCategory(category, from, point)`; `AddCategory()` (category popup under the new toolbar button "+ Category"); `EditPickedCategory()`; `ApplyCategory(category?, name, colorHex)` (null → "Add category", appended; else "Edit category" when changed); `DeleteCategory(category)` ("Delete category"; never the last one). `DocumentChanged` now calls `board?.RebuildSoon()`.
- `PlannerCategoryPopup.cs` (new, internal, like `PlannerTicketPopup`): Name box, `ColorPickerControl`, a button row (Delete — only when editing and more than one category — a spacer, Apply). Enter / Apply apply; empty name keeps the old one (or "New category"); Esc / outside click cancels.
- `GanttChartControl`: public `CategoryAt(point)`, private `RowAt(point)` (`TicketAt` now uses it); every press calls `editor.PickCategory(CategoryAt(point), this, point)`; a double click on a category row opens its popup (on a ticket row it still edits the ticket); `stopsContextMenu = true` (ancestors add nothing to its menu).
- `PlannerBoardControl`: `RebuildSoon()` (internal; one `Engine.Post`ed `Rebuild` per tick, skipped if the board was destroyed; flag `rebuildPending`); `Rebuild` is now private. Columns: `contextMenu = "planner-category"`, `stopsContextMenu = true`, press picks their category, double click opens its popup. `TicketCard`: press picks its category; returns handled only for a left press (so right-click reaches the column's menu); new `OnPointerTap` swallows taps so a double click on a card does not open the column's category. Cards show a row of initials chips (`chipHeight` 18, SubField, bold) when the ticket has assignees. `FinishDrag` calls `editor.MoveTicket` directly again (no `Engine.Post`).
- `PlannerActions`: `Planner.EditCategory`, `Planner.AddCategory`.
- Thorium data: `Planner.menu.xml` gains a line, "Edit category", "Add category"; new `PlannerCategory.menu.xml` (Edit category, Add category) registered as `planner-category` in `ThoriumAssets.assets.xml`.
- Tests: `Planner.CategoryEdits`, `Planner.CategoryPopup`, `Planner.AssigneeGolden` (golden `Planner.AssigneeGolden.Board.png`).

### Why
**Deleting a category leaves its tickets pointing at it.**
They show under the first category (`CategoryOf` fallback) while it is gone, and one undo brings the category back with its tickets in place; no per-ticket records. On save their `Category` attribute still names the deleted id, and on load they fall back to the first category. Rejected: reassigning every ticket to the first category — it needs a ticket record per ticket and loses where they were if the user saves before undoing; equal on save, worse on undo complexity. The last category cannot be deleted (a planner always has one).

**Entry points.**
Toolbar "+ Category"; double click a category row (Gantt) or a column (board); right-click "Edit category" / "Add category" (Gantt menu and the new board-column menu). "Edit category" acts on the category last pressed on — a right press counts — so the menu needs no target of its own.

**New categories start at `defaultColor`.**
The popup's picker is where a colour is chosen (no palette cycling).

**The layout-state bug, widened and fixed at the source.**
P3 found that rebuilding the board inside `FinishDrag` left stale layout state (a later `Perf.Controls.Scrollable.Relayout` logs `[UIEngine] 'entity' subtreeBounds (0, 0, 0, 0) != recomputed …` and `[Layout] skipped layout left … subtreeBounds stale`, only in the full `--test` run) and deferred the drop. P4 hit the identical errors from the category popup's Delete button: the delete rebuilt the board inside a *press* dispatch. Bisected again (removing `Planner.CategoryPopup` cleared it; deferring the delete cleared it). So the rule is not about `FinishDrag`: rebuilding (destroying controls) inside UIEngine's pointer dispatch — press, release, tap, drag end — corrupts layout state; doing it from posted work (`Engine.Post`) is safe. The fix moved to the source: `PlannerBoardControl.RebuildSoon` posts one rebuild per tick for every change (drop, popup Apply/Delete, undo, keys), and the two per-call deferrals were removed. Popup Apply on the board view (e.g. "+ Ticket" while the board shows) would have hit the same bug. The Gantt chart never destroys controls on a change (pooled parts), so it needs nothing. The engine root cause is still unguarded. See [[rebuild-inside-pointer-dispatch]].

**The category popup's button row has a fixed height.**
A horizontal `StackPanelControl` with a star spacer and no preferred height measured `float.MaxValue` tall (same trap as P1's card strip), which pushed the popup into its own OS window and, under `--test`, crashed with "Failed to create the context menu window". Seen via a temporary log in `ContextMenus.Host` (removed). See [[star-child-in-unbounded-stack]].

**`stopsContextMenu` on the chart and the board columns.**
So parent controls add nothing to the planner menus.

### Known gaps
- Category order cannot be changed (no reordering of columns / category rows).
- Duplicate category names: the ticket popup's dropdown resolves to the first.
- Deleted-category ticket ids stay in the file (harmless fallback, but never cleaned).
- The board shows a change one tick late (posted rebuild).
- **Verified:** test-verified — Planner suite 18 passed (Boot fails only on the baseline sampler error); full run 241 passed, 3 failed — Boot (baseline), `Sheet.FixedSize` (pre-existing), `Perf.TypeLargeNote` (baseline `[Layout] … desired stale`); no `[Vulkan]` lines. shot-verified: `Planner.AssigneeGolden`, approved in this change after reading the PNG (GR / AL chips on A, BO on C).
- **NOT GUI-verified:** the plan's "GUI check in a running Thorium" was not done — it would create a planner in the user's real vault and drive it with synthetic OS input (known traps in `aurora-verify`). Unchecked: "+ Category", the category popup (typing, picker, Delete), double clicks on rows/columns, right-click category menus, chips with many assignees, the deferred board rebuild's one-tick lag in a real session.

## PC — calendar view (landed 2026-10-07)

### What changed
- A third planner view, Calendar (Gantt | Board | Calendar): Day / Week time grids and a Month grid over the planner's tickets, overlap packing, a now line redrawn once a minute, create / move / resize with undo. Calendar C1 of [[calendar-plan]] is superseded by it.
- `CalendarSpan { Day, Week, Month }`; `CalendarControl : ContainerControl` (`ArctisAurora.Core.UI`). Consts: public `gutterWidth` 56, `headerHeight` 24, `laneHeight` 22, `hourHeight` 48; private `blockInset` 2, `labelHeight` 18, `cellHeader` 20, `chipHeight` 18, `nowWidth` 2, `dotSize` 8, `outlineWidth` 2, `grabHeight` 6, `attachmentAlpha` 0.4. `public static readonly TimeSpan snap` = 15 min.
- `CalendarControl` public members: `first` (`DateOnly`; Day = anchor, Week = the anchor's Monday, Month = the Monday on or before the 1st, 6×7 cells), `TopHeight` (pinned header + all-day strip, at least 1 lane), `BodyTop`, `PointAt(DateTime)`, `TimeAt(Vector2)` (unsnapped), `DayAt(Vector2)`, `BlockRect(ticket)` (first shown block, nullable), `TicketAt(point)`, static `Pack(IReadOnlyList<(DateTime start, DateTime end)>) → (int column, int columns)[]`; internal `Changed()`. `PointAt`, `BodyTop` and `TopHeight` are public for the tests.
- Overrides: `OnTick` (invalidates arrange when the minute of `editor.Now` changes; `FrameScheduler.RequestFrameAt` for the next minute boundary; `SetTicking(true)` in the ctor), `OnPointerPress`, `OnDrag`, `OnDragStop`, `OnPointerMove`, `OnPointerExit`, `OnPointerTap`. `contextMenu = "planner"`, `stopsContextMenu = true`.
- Private nested `CalendarParts` (the layer; renamed from a `ChartParts` copy, see [[parallel-stack-name-collisions]]), `CalendarPool<T>` (pooled parts per layer; hides what an arrange did not take), `Piece` struct, `PieceKind { Timed, AllDay, Chip }`, `Grip { Move, Start, End }`. Pieces are built in Measure (all-day lanes packed, then per-day timed pieces packed), rects in Arrange.
- Day / Week: hour gutter pinned left, day-name header and all-day strip pinned top. The strip holds all-day tickets and timed tickets of 24 h or more, packed into lanes. A timed ticket crossing midnight is one piece per day. Timed blocks under the pinned header are not hit. Now line + dot in Danger across today's column.
- Month: weekday row, 6×7 cells, day number (Accent today, MutedInk outside the month), chips "HH:mm Name" (all-day / long tickets: name only), "+N more" when a cell is full.
- Selection outline in Ink. A press on a block selects it and starts a drag: Day / Week timed — middle moves (across days), top / bottom edge resizes (VResize cursor), 15 min snap, minimum one snap; all-day strip and Month chips move by whole days. Release records through `editor.CommitTime`.
- Double click: a block opens the edit popup; an empty grid slot opens the new-ticket popup, 1 h from the slot floored to 15 min; the strip or a Month cell makes a new all-day ticket. Right click opens the `planner` menu.
- `PlannerEditorControl`: `PlannerView` gains `Calendar`; `calendar`; `span` (default Week); private `anchorDay`; `anchor` (today when unset); `ShowSpan(CalendarSpan)`; `Step(int direction)` (±1 day / 7 days / 1 month); `GoToday()`; `NewAt(TimeRange, Control from, Vector2 point)`. Toolbar gains a "Calendar" view button, `<` `Today` `>` step buttons and Day / Week / Month span buttons (shown only on Calendar; the zoom buttons stay Gantt-only), private `ShowIf`.
- The calendar opens scrolled to 07:00, and Day / Week following Month reopen at 07:00: private `pendingTop` + `MorningTop()`, applied in `PlannerScroller.ArrangeCore`. `EditSelected` anchors the popup under `calendar.BlockRect` on the calendar. `DocumentChanged` calls `calendar?.Changed()`.
- `ViewState` / `RestoreView` also store the span in `SessionTab.anchorBlock` and the anchor day as `DateOnly.DayNumber` in `topOffset` (0 = today).
- `PlannerTicketPopup.Open(editor, from, point, ticket, TimeRange? time = null)` — signature change; a new ticket uses `time`, else today all day.
- Tests (Thorium Planner suite, 28 after C2): `Planner.CalendarPack`, `Planner.CalendarGeometry`, `Planner.CalendarDragUndo`, `Planner.CalendarCreate`, `Planner.CalendarMonth`, `Planner.CalendarGolden` (goldens `Planner.CalendarGolden.Week.png`, `.Month.png`); extended `Planner.ViewState` (calendar span + anchor).

### Why
**The calendar's width is the viewport; no horizontal scroll.**
`ScrollableControl` measures its content at the viewport size, so no scroller change was needed.

**Pooled parts, never destroyed on a change.**
Like the Gantt, so the rebuild-inside-pointer-dispatch trap ([[rebuild-inside-pointer-dispatch]]) does not apply to the calendar.

**Packing.**
Sort by start, then longest; clusters of transitively overlapping spans; the first free column; a block's width is the day column's width divided by its cluster's column count. The all-day lanes use the same function. Packing uses the time including attachments.

**The step buttons are ASCII `<` `>`.**
The plan said ‹ ›; glyph coverage of the UI font was not checked.

**Month chips move only.**
Resize is Day / Week only.

**Session state reuses unused `SessionTab` fields** (`anchorBlock`, `topOffset`) rather than adding fields.

### Known gaps
- No drag-to-create on empty time; no resize in Month or in the all-day strip; a timed ticket cannot be dragged into the all-day strip.
- A taller ticket popup that does not fit below the click opens in its own OS window, where tests' `Find` (the primary window) cannot see it.
- Test trap: two clicks in a test count as a double click only if earlier presses are more than 250 ms old (`InputHandler` tap window, real timestamps); earlier tests' drags pushed `tapCount` to 4, so `Planner.CalendarCreate` waits 300 ms of wall time first.
- `timeZone` is still not applied.
- Other hosts' generated schemas (AuroraEditor / Carbon `UITypeSchema.xsd`, `actionSchema.xsd`) regenerate on their next run with the new types and action.
- **Verified** (covers PC and C2): test-verified — `bash _Build/test.sh Planner` → 28 passed (Boot fails only on the baseline sampler error); full run 251 passed, 3 failed — Boot (baseline sampler), `Sheet.FixedSize` (pre-existing), `Perf.TypeLargeNote` (baseline `[Layout] … desired stale`); no `[Vulkan]` lines. golden-verified — `Planner.CalendarGolden` Week (packing Review / Pairing / Lunch, selection outline, now line + dot at Tue 12:00, Offsite in the strip) and Month (chips, muted out-of-month days, selection), `Planner.AttachmentGolden` Gantt and Week; all four approved after reading the PNGs.
- **NOT GUI-verified:** no check in a running Thorium — real-mouse drags / resizes on the calendar, the VResize cursor, the toolbar step / span buttons, the now line advancing with the real clock, the popup's Before / After / Follows rows by hand, session restore across a restart.

## C2 — attachments and links (landed 2026-10-07)

### What changed
- Tickets carry attachments (time before / after, kinds from XML: Travel, Prep, custom) and a single "follows" link (B follows A). Moving A or changing A's end shifts everything downstream of it in the same undo step.
- `PlannerAttachments.cs`: `[A_XSDType("AttachmentKind","UI")] PlannerAttachmentKind` (`name`, `colorHex` default #8E8E93, `minutes` default 30); `[A_XSDType("AttachmentKinds","UI")] PlannerAttachmentKindMap` (the schema's root type); `readonly record struct PlannerAttachment(string kind, bool before, TimeSpan duration)`; static `PlannerAttachmentKinds` — `all`, `Find(name)` (case-insensitive), bootstrap step `[A_XSDActionDependency("PlannerAttachmentKinds.Load","Bootstrap")] Load()` reading the engine `Engine.attachments.xml`, then the host's optional `Attachments.attachments.xml` (a later same-name kind replaces an earlier one).
- Data: `Engine.attachments.xml` — Travel (#8E8E93, 30 min), Prep (#B48EDB, 15 min). `Bootstrap.bootstrap.xml` runs `PlannerAttachmentKinds.Load` after `Effects.LoadEffects`. Thorium ships no host file yet.
- `PlannerTicket`: `attachments` (`List<PlannerAttachment>`), `follows` (`Guid?`), `OuterStart` / `OuterEnd` (time including attachments), `Attached(bool before)`; `Clone` / `CopyFrom` copy both. `PlannerDocument.Find(Guid)`, `Followers(ticket)` (direct), `Upstream(ticket, other)` (true when `other` follows `ticket` directly or through others; cycle-guarded).
- `PlannerXml`: Ticket attribute `Follows="guid"` (written after `Order`); child `<Attachment Kind Side="Before|After" Minutes/>` (written after Assignee, before unknown children). An attachment without a kind or positive minutes is kept as unknown.
- `PlannerEditorControl.Apply` and `CommitTime` record `WithFollowers(ticket, before, after)` (private): the edit plus every ticket downstream shifted by the change of the ticket's END, transitively, visited-set guarded — one `PlannerTicketEdit`.
- `PlannerTicketPopup`: rows "Before" / "After" (comma text "Travel 30m, Prep 1h"; `1h30` = 90 min; a bare number = minutes; no length = the kind's default; an unknown kind is dropped; internal `FormatAttachments`, `ParseAttachments`) and "Follows" (`DropdownControl` "(none)" + every ticket except this one and those downstream of it).
- `GanttChartControl`: attachments are blocks in the kind's colour at alpha 0.4 before / after the bar in its row (`attachmentParts`, bars layer); link elbows (`linkParts`, grid layer, MutedInk, `elbowWidth` 8: right from A's end, down / up to B's row, across to B's start) are drawn when either row is in view; the span uses `OuterStart` / `OuterEnd`. The calendar draws attachments at the same alpha, and packs with the outer time.
- Tests: `Planner.FollowersMove`, `Planner.FollowCycle`, `Planner.AttachmentText`, `Planner.AttachmentGolden` (goldens `Planner.AttachmentGolden.Gantt.png`, `.Week.png`); extended `Planner.XmlRoundTrip` (Follows, Attachment).

### Why
**An attachment is a translucent block in the kind's colour, not dashed.**
The user's pick (1a). The engine has no dashed drawing; a dashed outline from pooled segments would mean many more parts and is invisible at Week / Month Gantt zoom.

**"Follows" shifts followers by the leader's END change, applied on release.**
The user's pick (2a). A move changes the end, so followers shift; resizing only the start leaves them; popup edits that move the end shift them too. Rejected: pushing B only when it would start before A ends — a constraint solver, and gaps become unpredictable. Rejected: followers moving live during a drag — extra per-frame work; they jump on release instead.

**One leader per ticket, `Guid? follows`.**
The user's pick (3a): many may follow one; the popup excludes downstream tickets so the UI cannot make a cycle. Rejected: a list of leaders — it needs a list editor in the popup instead of a dropdown.

**The Gantt link elbows are drawn.**
The user's pick (4 in).

**Attachment kinds are engine data, like gradients and palettes.**
An engine file plus an optional host file, loaded by a bootstrap step (the agreed outline). Rejected: kinds stored per planner file.

**Attachments are edited as comma text,** the same stub style as assignees.

### Known gaps
- Found during verification: `Planner.AttachmentText` clicking the popup's Apply button (close + apply inside a pointer press dispatch, a P2 code path) made the later `Perf.Controls.Scrollable.Relayout` log `[UIEngine] 'entity' subtreeBounds (0, 0, 0, 0) != recomputed …` and `[Layout] skipped layout left … subtreeBounds stale` (×8) in the full run. Bisected by adding tests back one batch at a time to the full run; applying with Enter instead cleared it, and the test now uses Enter. The popup's Apply button is unchanged, so the unguarded engine trap is still reachable through it. See [[rebuild-inside-pointer-dispatch]].
- Attachments are not drawn on the board, in Month chips, or for all-day tickets in the calendar strip.
- Followers move only on release, not live.
- Duplicate ticket names: the Follows dropdown resolves to the first.
- A deleted leader leaves `follows` pointing at a missing id (ignored; undo restores).
- The Gantt link elbow's first segment sits under an after-attachment block (it starts at the leader's end).
- Verification: see the PC section.
