# Decision — Carbon is a fourth application, and the frame file is read where it is written

**Date:** 2026-09-02
**Status:** LANDED, v1. Builds clean. **GUI-verified** — booted, a session loaded, all four views
drawn, zoom and pan exercised, every number cross-checked against the file that produced it. Verified
against a synthetic three-thread capture from the real writer **and against two real Thorium
captures** (300 frames of `Main`/`Render`/`Physics`, F9, clean exit).
**Ported 2026-09-13:** the views are `FrameStripControl`, `SessionListControl`, `SpanChartControl`
(+ `ChartScrollThumbControl`) and `ZoneTableControl` on the new UI stack; the old names below are the
same classes before the port. See [[ui-engine-plan]] § 6c2.
**Scope:** new `Carbon/` project; `ArctisAurora.Core.Diagnostics.FrameCaptureReader`;
`Thorium/Data/XML/Documents/Inputs/InputMap.inputs.xml`.

## What was there before

`FrameSpool` wrote `Profiling/<session>/<thread>.frames.xml` and **nothing read them**. No capture
had ever been produced by a real application either — `Mode` defaults to `Off` and nothing bound
`Profiling.Capture`. See [[engine-profiling]] for the writer.

## Decisions

### 1. A fourth application, not a Thorium panel (user, 2026-09-02)

The roadmap said the viewer was a panel on the test/profiling platform, sequenced after Thorium v1.
It is instead **`Carbon`**, a host application beside `Thorium` and `AuroraEditor`: same engine, same
UI, its own window. Dogfoods the UI exactly as the roadmap item wanted, without waiting for Thorium
v1 and without putting a profiler pane inside a note editor.

**Rejected: a standalone HTML viewer.** Canvas gives zoom, pan and hover free, and it would have
validated the XML before the format was baked into an engine panel. Rejected because it is a second
UI stack in a repo that deliberately owns its own, and it would be thrown away when the platform
lands.

**Rejected: a C# tool emitting a static report.** Stays in C#, but loses hover, zoom and pan, which
is most of the value once a capture is 240 frames deep.

### 2. The reader is engine-side, the drawing is Carbon-side (user, 2026-09-02)

`FrameCaptureReader` sits in `Core/Diagnostics` next to `FrameSpool` — one format, one place, and
`WriteFrame` read backwards is the whole implementation. The four controls stay in
`Carbon/Editor/CustomControls/`, unlike the planned `LogViewControl` which [[log-viewer-plan]] puts
in the engine. Nothing else wants them yet; promoting one later is a namespace move.

### 3. Truncation is an outcome, not an error

A file whose process died has no `</FrameCapture>`, so `XmlReader` throws at EOF. That is caught,
`truncated` is set, and **everything already read is kept**. The frame the writer died inside is
dropped — its spans are unreferenced by any committed frame, so they are trimmed rather than left as
orphans. Verified by chopping 200 bytes off a good file: 5 of 6 frames survive, `truncated` is true,
`spans.Count` ends exactly at the last frame's slice.

`<Z … />` **is emitted self-closing** when a span has no children and no counters, so the reader
tracks `IsEmptyElement` rather than waiting for an `EndElement` that never comes. This was the one
real trap in the format; a `Draw` span sitting as a sibling of `Layout` is the case that catches it.

### 4. One control draws both the flame chart and the timeline

`SpanChartControl` takes a window of the absolute clock and a set of lanes. `Mode="Frame"` pins the
window to the selected frame with one lane; `Mode="Timeline"` gives every thread and lets the window
zoom and pan. A single-frame flame chart *is* the degenerate aligned timeline — [[engine-profiling]]
§10 made `<F T>` process-wide precisely so the lanes share an axis, so building the two separately
would have been the same layout twice.

**Row 0 of a lane is the frame, and spans start at row 1.** The gap between the root span's end and
the frame bar's end is the parked tail, drawn without being computed.

### 5. A timeline opens on a count of frames, and the count is the selected thread's

Opening the timeline on the whole capture was a blank pane, and correctly so: 7.65 s across 919 px is
8.3 ms per pixel, so a 5 ms frame is 0.6 px and every span culls itself against `MinSpanWidth`.

**Rejected: a fixed `DefaultWindowMs`.** 200 ms was fine for the synthetic capture and blank for the
real one, where main does ~0.3 ms of work per 8.4 ms frame — 1.4 px, just under the cull. A duration
cannot be a constant when the thing it has to frame is a frame.

**Rejected: the tightest interval across threads.** Threads run free and record N frames *each*, so
Thorium's render thread finished its 300 at ~0.47 ms apart while main's took 8.4 ms apart; taking the
minimum collapsed the window to 4.7 ms and showed one main frame and nothing else.

So `_windowSpan` is left **unset** by `SetSession` and sized by the first `SetFrame` from *that
thread's* frame interval × `DefaultWindowFrames` (10). Selecting a frame afterwards **re-centres
without changing the zoom**, so clicking a spike in the strip lands on it in both charts.

### 6. Materialisation is windowed, and that is real virtualization

A span outside the window is not built, one under `MinSpanWidth` (1.5 px) is not built, and
`MaxRects` truncates the rest. Unlike [[log-viewer-plan]]'s 500-entry cap this is not a mitigation —
an off-window span genuinely has nothing to draw. Rects and labels are **pooled and reused**, hidden
rather than destroyed, because a drag emits events far faster than 720 entities can be recreated.
Label text is only reassigned when it actually changes, since a label is one `GlyphControl` per
character.

Rebuilding happens on data change, zoom and pan — **never inside `Arrange`**, because `AddChild`
invalidates layout and layout is what would be calling.

### 7. The frame strip buckets, and a bucket stands for its longest frame

`MaxBars` (200) per lane. With more frames than bars a bar covers a run of them and reports the
**longest**, never the mean, so a spike cannot average away. Bars are not hit-testable; the strip
maps the click itself, which is one handler instead of 600 controls that each own one.

### 8. The aggregate is rolled up from the stream, and disagrees with the report on purpose

Zone totals, calls, min/max and counters are derived at load, per [[engine-profiling]] §8's point
that the aggregate is derivable from the stream and not the reverse. The rollup sums **every span
instance**, so a zone that re-enters itself totals more here than the 1-second report's
outermost-only rule gives it. The two are documented as disagreeing; no shipped zone re-enters today.

### 9. Scale is a ruler and a number on the span, not a gridded background (user, 2026-09-03)

Rectangles against nothing say how long *nothing* took. Two additions, deliberately separate:

- **A duration beside every span's name** — `MainTick 0.841ms`. `LabelMinWidth` rose 44 → 70 px so a
  half-drawn number never appears, and span labels became `clipOutOfBounds` so a long caption is
  truncated inside its own rectangle instead of running over the next span, which they had been doing.
- **A time ruler across the top**, ticks on a 1/2/5 × 10ⁿ step chosen so marks land ≥ 80 px apart.

**Marks stay in the ruler row; no gridlines down through the lanes** (user, 2026-09-03). Full-height
rules would read cross-thread alignment better and were offered on that basis; the repeating vertical
pattern behind every lane was not wanted.

**Offsets are anchored to the capture's start, not the window's**, so panning slides the numbers
instead of renumbering them from zero.

That anchoring is what makes the label format non-obvious: a flame chart's window is one frame, ~0.8 ms
wide, sitting a whole second into the capture, so **precision has to come from the step and not from
the magnitude**. Formatting `1.1254 s` by its size prints `1.13s` on all eight marks. `Decimals()`
takes `-log10(step)` in whatever unit is being printed, which gives `1.09s` at a 10 ms step and
`1.1254s` at a 0.1 ms one.

### 10. The zone table is a call tree, not a sorted list (user, 2026-09-03)

Rows nest by the depth the span stream already carries: spans arrive in pre-order, so an
`openNames[depth]` stack names each zone's parent the same way the reader recovers nesting. Rows emit
depth-first with **siblings ordered by total**, indented by a left margin, the name column narrowing
to match.

**The consequence is that the most expensive zone is no longer the first row** — it is the biggest
number at whatever depth it sits. That is the trade for nesting, and it is what makes the table line
up with the flame chart beside it.

Depth is carried by a **swatch bar** at each row's left edge in the chart's own `DepthColorsHex`, not
by tinting the text: that palette is mid-tone fills and would be low-contrast as type on `#F2F1ED`.
A 1 px rule separates one thread's zones from the next.

A zone whose recorded parent never became a row would silently vanish, so a second pass emits any
zone the tree walk missed at depth 0. Nothing hits it today; a diagnostic table quietly dropping a
row is the failure worth spending five lines on.

### 11. Allocation shows on every span, on the frame bar and in the table (2026-09-03)

[[engine-profiling]] §12 put bytes on every span and every frame. Carbon draws all four of them:

- **The zone table's thread header** carries the thread's whole allocation over the capture, summed
  from `<F A>` — which includes what ran outside any zone, so it is larger than the root zone's.
- **A zone row's detail line** carries that zone's bytes, rolled up the same way its time is.
- **The frame bar's caption** (row 0 of a lane) carries the frame's bytes beside the thread name.
- **A span's caption** carries that span's own bytes, third after its name and duration.

**Reversed 2026-09-03: spans were first shipped without bytes and now carry them** (user — a boot
capture reads `Bootstrap 243.58MB` on the frame bar with nothing on `Settings.LoadAll`, which is the
number actually wanted). The original reason stands as a *consequence*, not a veto: a span needs
`LabelMinWidth` (70 px) to earn a caption at all, and `{name} {duration} {bytes}` overruns a bar
barely over that threshold — span labels are `clipOutOfBounds`, so the bytes are what clips off.
Deliberately not traded for: a wider `LabelMinWidth` (fewer labelled spans), or dropping the duration.
Both charts take it, since `Flame` and `Timeline` are one control.

**The number is inclusive, matching §12 of [[engine-profiling]]** — a parent span's bytes contain its
children's, the same way the zone table's rollup does. Bootstrap steps are flat so the boot capture
reads as self-bytes; a nested zone does not.

A span that allocated nothing keeps the two-part caption, because `<Z>` is written without an `A` and
the caption branches on `bytes != 0` — which is also what an older capture file, written before
allocation existed, reads back as.

Formatting is `CapturedThread.Bytes`, a static beside the instance `Ms` — one place both controls
share, on the reader's side of the boundary §2 draws.

### 12. The timeline scrolls with a bar; the flame chart does not (user, 2026-09-03)

The timeline panned by dragging its body and zoomed on the wheel, with nothing on screen saying where
the window sat in the capture. A track across the plot column, with a thumb whose width is
`_windowSpan / _boundsSpan` and whose offset is `(_windowStart - _boundsStart) / ScrollRange`, says
both at once and drags.

**Nothing in the engine could be reused.** `ScrollableControl.ArrangeThumb` returns before doing
anything unless `CanScrollVertical`, so there is no horizontal scrollbar to inherit, and
`ScrollThumbControl` takes a `ScrollableControl` in its constructor and writes through
`SetScrollOffset`. `ChartScrollThumbControl` is Carbon's own `ButtonControl` — which is also what buys
the hover and press tints for free. `SpanChartControl` exposes `ThumbTravel`, `WindowStart`,
`ScrollRange` and `ScrollTo`, deliberately the shape of `ThumbTravel` / `MaxScrollOffset` /
`SetScrollOffset`, so the thumb's arithmetic is the engine's with X substituted for Y.

**Frame mode gets no bar.** Its window *is* the frame the strip picked, so the thumb would be a
hairline standing for a window nothing may move, and dragging it would fight the strip for ownership
of `_windowStart`. Track and thumb arrange to `LayoutRect.Empty`, which draws no pixels and fails the
hit-test — the same collapse `ScrollableControl` uses when its content fits.

**The bar takes no vertical room from the lanes.** It is pinned to `inner.Bottom` rather than placed
below the deepest lane, because lanes already grow unbounded downward: reserving space would have
changed existing geometry to avoid a collision three lanes never reach.

**Rejected: clicking the track to page or jump.** The engine's scrollbar has no track control at all,
let alone that behaviour, and a press on the track falls through to the chart and pans, which is what
was already there.

Colours are XML attributes on the `Timeline` element, the `Thumb*ColorHex` triple `SessionList` and
`ZoneTable` already carry. `Flame` is left without them, since it never draws one.

Measured in the running app against a real 60-frame capture: track 425→1383 px, thumb 70 px — 7.3% of
it, for a ~137 ms window on a ~1.9 s capture — and hover resolving to `#C9C6BC`. **The drag itself was
confirmed by the user, not by the harness**: a scripted press registered the press tint and then never
moved the thumb, so that path proved nothing either way.

### 13. The two charts split 1:2 and the split drags (user, 2026-09-03)

`Flame` and `Timeline` were `HeightStar="1"` each, so a boot capture — one lane, a handful of
bootstrap steps — got the same half of the column as a three-thread timeline. `Timeline` is now
`HeightStar="2"` and a `Splitter` sits between them.

**Both panes keep their stars; the grip trades weight between them.** That is a new path in
`SplitterControl` and the reason it exists — see [[splitter-and-pane-sizing]]'s second amendment. The
alternative was pinning `Flame` to a pixel height and leaving `Timeline` the only star, which is the
shape the engine already had, but then the 1:2 the user asked for could only be authored as a number
that stops being 1:2 the moment the window resizes.

**`MinHeight="10"` on both** (user, 2026-09-03). It is the drag's clamp only — `StackPanelControl`
does not enforce `minHeight` on a star child, so a small enough window still squeezes past it.

**`ClipToBounds="true"` on both, which they did not carry before.** Neither chart clipped: lanes grow
downward from `inner.y + rulerHeight` unbounded (§12), and until the panes could be dragged small
that never reached anything. A pane at its 10 px floor would otherwise paint its lanes over its
neighbour.

The ruler's step is unaffected — `Ticks()` chooses from `PlotWidth()` and this grip moves heights, so
the "no `Rebuild` on resize" gap below is not reachable through it.

### 14. Two captures compare through a pinned baseline, in the zone table only (2026-09-13)

The user left the shape to Claude ("I'll let you decide"). Before this, comparing meant two Carbon
processes or flicking between sessions.

- `Carbon.PinBaseline` hands `SessionListControl.Loaded` to `ZoneTableControl.SetBaseline`;
  `Carbon.ClearBaseline` passes `null`. Every session loaded afterwards is diffed against it.
- While pinned, a zone's number is **ms per frame** and a delta column reads `+16.05 +372%`, coloured
  `SlowerColorHex` / `FasterColorHex` by the sign of the change *as printed*. A `compared with <name>`
  row leads the table and each thread header adds `vs <baseline frames>`.
- Matching is **thread name + zone name**, the key the roll-up already collapses on. A zone only in the
  loaded capture reads `new`; one only in the baseline trails its thread as `<zone> — gone, was X ms/f`;
  a thread only in the baseline gets a header line.
- The roll-up left `Fill` for `Roll(thread, counters, out bytes)`, so both captures go through one path.

**The zone table is the only view where two runs share keys.** Frame N of one run has no counterpart in
another, so the strip, flame chart and timeline side by side are still two pictures compared by eye.
Rejected: a second set of views (A/B columns) — more UI, same eyeballing; a second window in the same
process — cheapest, and equivalent to the two Carbons the user said did not work.

**Per frame, because totals sum however many frames the file holds.** Continuous captures hold any number:
2000 frames against 1500 reads −25% on every zone before anything changed. min/max are per instance
already and stay on the detail line untouched.

**ms/f only while pinned**, so a single capture still reads in totals, the way §8's report does.

**A button pins, not a session row**, because a folder picked through Load XML outside `captureRoot`
never becomes a row. The `compared with` row names the baseline wherever it came from.

The strip half of "two pictures compared by eye" is superseded by §15; the zone table's diff stands.

### 15. A second frame strip holds the compared capture; the charts follow the last click (user, 2026-09-14)

The user found §14 "not understandable at all" and specified the shape; the forks were theirs.

- `Strip` holds the pinned baseline, `CompareStrip` under it the capture loaded after pinning (fork 1a).
  **Swap** flips them. Nothing pinned: `Strip` holds the loaded capture and `CompareStrip` stays empty.
- Flame and Timeline show the **last bar clicked in either strip**; the other strip's highlight clears.
  The zone table is unchanged, still loaded vs baseline (fork 2a).
- **Slide left / right** moves the lower strip's frames one column. **Swap negates the offset**, so the
  alignment survives the flip. Pin and Clear reset the offset; the swap flag persists.
- **Scale** 0–1: a lower lane's heights divide by `own + (counterpart − own) × t`, both that thread's
  longest frame. Bars clamp at the lane height. The upper strip is always 0.
- `Carbon.Editor.Comparison` (static) owns loaded, baseline, swap, offset, scale and what the charts show;
  `Carbon.Wire` only hands it the views. The picker is the engine's new `ArctisAurora.Core.UI.SliderControl`
  (fork 3c). `offset +3` and `0.49` are labels in the row, not part of the slider (fork 4).

**Lanes and columns are shared between the two strips, or the picture lies.**
- Lanes are the union of both captures' thread names, ordinal, so lane N is the same thread in both. A
  thread one side lacks is a label-only lane.
- A lane's columns are the longer of the two captures' frame counts for that thread; bars are
  `min(columns, MaxBars)`. A bucket is a column range less the offset (`From`), so frame `i` sits at the
  same x in both strips. §7's rule bucketed each strip over its own count, which put frame 1000 of a
  2000-frame run under frame 750 of a 1500-frame one.
- A frame slid past either edge is not drawn; an empty bucket arranges to `LayoutRect.Empty`. The axis
  does not grow with the offset, so a slide moves bars and never rescales either strip.

**Selection is (thread, frame), not (lane, bar).** A slide re-buckets and a swap rebuilds both strips, so
a bar index would highlight whatever lands there next. `Mark` highlights without reporting — it is how
`Comparison` clears the other strip and carries the highlight across a swap. `SetSession` no longer
selects; `SelectPeak` does, for the capture just loaded.

**The charts `SetSession` only when the clicked capture differs from the shown one**, so clicking within
one capture keeps the timeline's zoom (§5). Clicking across captures resets it.

**Rejected:** one control drawing both captures' lanes — the user asked for "another one under it", and
two instances reuse all of §7. A Carbon-local slider — the user chose the engine.

**Follow-up the same day (user, 2026-09-14):**
- **`CompareStrip` is hidden while nothing compares** and takes no space (user: "only there when there's
  something to compare to"). `Attach` hides it; `Refresh` shows it only with a lower capture. This needed
  `StackPanelControl` to skip `hidden` children in measure, star share and arrange, and
  `Control.Show()` to clear `MeasureDirty` before `InvalidateLayout` — see Facts.
- **The slide buttons are 28×28 icon buttons**, `chevron-left-outline` / `chevron-right-outline`: hollow
  chevrons, two opposite-wound contours (user chose hollow over mirroring the filled `chevron-right`).
- **`Label` never wraps** (user: a zone name ran onto the detail line). The zone name label sets
  `clipOutOfBounds`, so a long name is cut at its column, mid-glyph (fork 1a, over `...` truncation).
- `NoteNameWindow` lost its 1 px width trick for the hidden "Don't save" button, which only existed
  because a hidden stack child kept its slot.

### 16. Pools show as a summary in the table and a readout of the clicked frame (user, 2026-09-14)

The capture side is [[engine-profiling]] §14. The user chose fork 2b over the table alone (2a) and over pool
lanes in the frame strip (2c).

- `ZoneTableControl.Pools(thread)` runs after each thread's `Fill`: a `pools` header, then one two-line row
  per pool, in first-recorded order — name with **peak** bytes on the right, then
  `items min-max, last N, capacity peak`. Rolled over the whole capture into `RolledPool`.
- A `Label Name="Pools"` sits between `CompareStrip` and `Flame`. `Comparison.Show` sets it to the clicked
  frame's pools, `name count/capacity bytes`, four spaces apart; `Comparison.Attach` takes it as a new last
  parameter.
- A thread that recorded no pools gets no block and an empty readout — `Render`, `Physics`, `Bootstrap` and
  every capture written before §14.

**Peak, not last, on the right.** The column is what the pool cost at worst. Last is in the detail line,
beside the item range.

**The readout follows the clicked thread, not Main.** A `Render` frame clears it rather than looking up the
`Main` frame that overlaps its timestamp; that lookup is §5's free-running-threads problem again.

**No baseline diff for pools.** §14's per-frame delta is zones only.

**Rejected (2c): pool lanes in the frame strip.** It is the view that shows a pool over time, but a lane is a
thread today, and bucketing a count is a different rule from §7's longest-frame bucket.

**Verified, GUI:** on a `--profile=3000 --profile-pools` capture of Carbon itself, loaded through Load XML — the
block read `UIElements 328.0KB / items 98-1219, last 1219, capacity 2048`, and a click on Main's load spike read
`UIControls 0/1024 260.0KB    UIElements 809/1024 164.0KB    Entities 0/1024 60.0KB`. The Bootstrap frame the
session opened on left the readout empty.

## Facts that were expensive to establish

- **A `widthStar` `LabelControl` inside a horizontal `StackPanel` is measured at width 0 and wraps to
  one glyph per line.** `StackPanelControl.Measure` offers a horizontal star child
  `new Vector2D<float>(0, inner.height)`, and `LabelControl` does **not** override
  `TextControl.WrapWidth`, so `contentWidth` is 0. An 8-character zone name became a 155 px row. Use
  fixed `preferredWidth` columns in a horizontal strip, or a control that overrides `WrapWidth`.
- **A control outside the engine assembly cannot clear `isMeasureDirty` / `isArrangeDirty`** — both
  are `internal set`. A custom container calls `base.Measure` / `base.Arrange` for the transform, the
  clip and the flags, then positions its own children afterwards. `PanelControl` overrides neither,
  so `base` is `VulkanControl`'s.
- **`Hide()` collapses the clip, and `Arrange` rewrites it.** A hidden child must be *skipped* by its
  parent's `Arrange`, not merely hidden, or it reappears.
- **A child its parent skips can stay `MeasureDirty` forever, and then `Show()` lays nothing out.**
  `InvalidateLayout` returns at the first already-dirty control, so a strip dirtied by `SetSession` while
  hidden made `Show()` register no dirty root. `Show()` now clears `MeasureDirty` before invalidating.
- **Debug paths resolve against the working directory.** `Paths.GetPath` returns
  `Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine("..","..","..", path))`, so an app must be launched from its own
  `bin/Debug/<tfm>/`. `dotnet run` sets the repo root instead and boot dies at `XSDGenerator` with
  `DirectoryNotFoundException: D:\Data\XML\Schemas\…`. Visual Studio gets this right by default.
- **`Shaders/` is per application by the same rule** — `UIModule` reads
  `"../../../Shaders/UIRasterizer/UI.vert.spv"` and `RenderWindow` builds a `CompositorModule`
  unconditionally, so Carbon needs four `.spv` copies. **That makes four copies of the UI shaders,
  not three**; `CLAUDE.md` and [[../Context/where-things-live]] said three and were corrected.
- **Carbon's `Data/Fonts` and `Data/Icons` are copied from Thorium with their `.import.xml` stamps**,
  so first boot bakes nothing (`AssetImporter.RunImports` — 13 ms). Without the stamps it would bake
  into `Carbon/Data/Fonts`, since `Paths.FONTS` is the *running app's* folder.
- **`InputHandler.ParseXML` throws on an action name it cannot resolve**, so a dangling `Action=` is a
  boot failure, not a warning. It matches on the attribute's name only and ignores the category.
- **`ExitApplication` is defined per application**, in each host's `Decorations.cs`, not in the
  engine. Carbon needed its own.
- **U+2026 (`…`) is not in the baked charset**, so "Load XML…" renders as "Load XML". Thorium's
  "Add vault…" has the same hole. **Neither is U+2014 (`—`)**: every zone-table thread header has always
  drawn `Main   1500 frames`, and §14's `gone` / `only in baseline` rows inherit the gap.

## Left standing

- **No `.xsd` for the frame format** (user, 2026-09-02 — asked for a Load XML button instead).
  `PROFILING.md` had promised the schema would ship with the reader; it does not. The reader is the
  only consumer and it is hand-written, so a schema would validate only files the engine itself wrote.
- **"Load XML" picks a folder, not a file.** `FolderPicker` is the only picker the engine has
  (`FOS_PICKFOLDERS`), and a session is a folder of per-thread files, which is what the aligned
  timeline wants. A single-file picker needs a `FolderPicker.PickFile` that does not exist.
- **Zoom is about the window centre, not the pointer** — `ResolveOnScrollUp/Down()` take no
  coordinates.
- **A resize does not `Rebuild`.** `Ticks()` picks its step from `PlotWidth()`, so after the window is
  resized the ruler keeps the step it chose at the old width — 10 ms marks were seen 70 px apart,
  under `tickMinSpacing`'s 80 — until the next zoom, pan or frame selection re-runs it.
- **Nothing draws counters in the charts.** They are in the aggregate table only.
- **No live tailing of a Continuous session, no export.**
- **The baseline diff is a mean per frame and nothing else** — no median, no p95, no noise band. A
  `+13%` on a 0.03 ms/f zone between two runs is as likely noise as change. It is not persisted across
  a restart, and a pinned session stays in memory beside the loaded one.
- **Per-frame numbers print `F2`**, so a zone under 5 µs/frame reads `0.00ms/f` beside a real
  percentage (`FrameEdge 0.00ms/f 0.00 -10%`). `TotalWidth="74"` just holds `20.37ms/f`; a third
  decimal needs the column wider.
- **The flame chart and timeline show one capture at a time.** Only the strips sit side by side (§15);
  only the zone table diffs numbers.
- **A slide is one frame, and past `MaxBars` a bar is several.** On rearrange captures (1500–6000 frames
  per thread) a press moves bucket edges by less than a bar and can look like nothing happened. Boot
  captures (≤120 frames) move a bar per press.
- **The offset is the whole strip's, not per thread.** Threads run free (§5), so aligning Main can
  misalign Render.
- **A selected frame slid out of range loses its highlight** while the charts keep showing it.
- **Offset, scale and swap are not persisted.**
- **`Periodic/` at the repo root still holds a stray `obj/`**, dead since the 2026-08 rename.
  Unrelated, untouched.

| session list | folder listed newest first with its thread names, no parsing |
| load | 1200 / 720 / 480 spans and 480 / 240 / 0 counters — the generator's exact counts |
| strip | 3 lanes × 200 bars, click re-selects and retints across lanes |
| flame | frame bar, `MainTick`, then `PollEvents`/`HandleUI`/`Interpolate`, `Layout` inside `HandleUI` |
| timeline | 3 lanes interleaved, tick rates visibly 11.1 / 16.6 / 32 ms apart |
| zoom / pan | 4 wheel notches widened the labels; a drag scrolled and clipped a frame at the edge |
| aggregate | `Module 2880` = 12 × 240, `Window 240` = 1 × 240, every min/max inside its generated range |
| sum check | `RenderTick` 1413.23 ms vs `Draw` + `Present` = 1412.82 ms |

Against two real Thorium captures (`%APPDATA%\Thorium\Profiling\`, 300 frames per thread):

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| real names | `MainTick`, `PollEvents`, `ActivateKeybinds`, `HandleUI`, `Interpolate`, `FrameEdge`, counter `Window` |
| aggregate | `MainTick` 47.73 ms x300 (min 0.101 max 0.841), `Interpolate` 27.24, `HandleUI` 9.93 — `Window 300` |
| render | `RenderTick` 128.75 ms x300, `Draw` 128.47 — so Draw is essentially all of the render tick |
| empty frames | `Physics` reads 300 frames and **zero** spans, from self-closing `<F … />` |
| alignment | at the capture's start Render packs the lane while Main shows 3 frames in the same 84 ms |
| span durations | flame reads `MainTick 0.841ms` and `HandleUI 0.222ms` — the table's `max` for both |
| ruler, timeline | `1.09s … 1.16s` on a 10 ms step across an 84 ms window |
| ruler, flame | `1.1254s … 1.1261s` on a 0.1 ms step across one 0.846 ms frame |
| ruler under zoom | five wheel notches re-stepped 10 ms → 5 ms, precision following it |
| call tree | `MainTick` over `Interpolate` 27.24 / `HandleUI` 9.93 / `PollEvents` 5.44 / `ActivateKeybinds` 3.39 / `FrameEdge` 0.43, and `RenderTick` over `Draw` |
| separators | rules above `Physics` and `Render`, none above the first thread |

§14's baseline, **GUI-verified** 2026-09-13 against real Thorium captures, every number checked against
a scratch roll-up over the XML outside the repo:

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| pin `Stage0-0200k-rearrange`, itself loaded | every change `0.00 0%`; `MainTick 4.32`, `Interpolate 4.22`, `ResolveLayout 0.18` ms/f — the script's |
| load `Stage0-1000k-rearrange`, 1500 frames vs 2000 | `MainTick 20.37 +16.05 +372%`, `Interpolate +16.04 +380%`, `ResolveLayout +0.98 +536%`, `ActivateKeybinds -22%` — all nine zones match |
| clear | totals again, `MainTick 30550.11ms` = 20.37 × 1500 |
| pin `Stage0-1000k-boot`, load the rearrange | faster colour on `MainTick -5.17 -20%`; `Bootstrap only in baseline` last |
| `new` / `gone` zone rows | **NOT GUI-verified** — no two real captures differ in zone names |

§15's two strips, **GUI-verified** 2026-09-14 by synthetic clicks and captures, pin `Stage0-1000k-boot`
then load `Stage0-0200k-boot`:

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| load, nothing pinned | upper strip as before, lower empty, `offset 0`, `1.00` |
| load while pinned | baseline upper, loaded lower with its Bootstrap peak lit; upper highlight cleared |
| unequal counts | lower `Physics` (64 frames vs 120) ends at half width |
| Slide right ×3 | `offset +3`; lower bars 3 columns right; 1-frame `Bootstrap` slid out, lane empty |
| Swap | `offset -3`; 0200k upper with its shown frame re-lit; 1000k lower, first 3 frames cut |
| scale 0 by press | `0.00`; lower lanes fill their own height |
| scale by drag | thumb dragged to mid, `0.49` |
| click a lower bar | that bar lit, upper cleared, flame on `Main 74.82ms` |
| Clear | lower empty, `offset 0`, upper 0200k at its own counts, charts back on its peak |
| follow-up: one capture | no lower strip; flame chart directly under the upper one |
| follow-up: pin + load | lower strip appears, drawn — the capture it took while hidden |
| follow-up: icons | hollow chevrons (8× crop); right ×2, left ×1 → `offset +1` |
| follow-up: Clear | lower strip gone, space closed |
| follow-up: zone name | `AssetRegistries.RegisterSerializabl` cut at its column, detail line clear |
| follow-up: Thorium boot | documents still wrap, labels one line |
| >`MaxBars` captures, "Don't save" prompt layout | **NOT GUI-verified** |

Three things that capture said about the **engine**, not about Carbon:

- **`FrameEdge` is not in `ThreadedSystem.Loop`.** `Loop` has `Frame.Begin`/`End` and `Report`, and
  nothing else; `FrameEdge` is one of `Engine.MainTick`'s zones. [[engine-profiling]] §11 and
  `PROFILING.md` both claim "the frame edges themselves are in `ThreadedSystem.Loop`, so every system
  has them, physics included" — **that is wrong**, and Physics recording 300 spanless frames is the
  proof. Not corrected here; it is the profiler's note to fix.
- **The render thread ticks about 18× faster than main** — ~0.47 ms between frames against ~8.4 ms.
- **A burst of N frames covers a different wall-clock span on every thread**, so the threads only
  overlap near the *start* of a capture. Render's 300 frames spanned ~141 ms; main's spanned ~2.5 s.
  Continuous mode would not have this shape.
