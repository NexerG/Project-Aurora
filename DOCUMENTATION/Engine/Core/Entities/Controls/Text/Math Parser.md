## Description

Turns the TeX of a math formula — what sits between `$…$` or `$$…$$` in a note — into a tree of math nodes that [[Math Layout]] can place. It reads TeX math mode only: scripts, fractions, roots, `\left…\right`, accents, `\text`, `\mathrm`, `\mathbf`, `\mathbb`, spacing commands, operator names, Greek letters and the symbols listed in `MathSymbols`.

It never throws. Anything it cannot read — an unknown command, an unbalanced brace, a double superscript — turns the whole formula into a single `MathError` that keeps the source, which layout then shows as plain text flagged as an error.

The parser knows nothing of sheets. A `\sheet{…}` cell reference in a formula is replaced by the cell's value before the source reaches it, so it only ever sees ordinary TeX. See [[Sheet Editor]].

> Notes hold, draw, save and copy formulas; they cannot yet be inserted or edited in the editor. See `ClaudeMemory/Context/math-plan.md`.

## API summary

| Member | Kind | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Parse(string tex)` | static | The formula as a `MathList`, or a `MathError` when any part of it cannot be read. |

## Nodes

| Node | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `MathList` | a `{…}` group or the whole formula: a list of nodes |
| `MathSymbol` | one character, its face, its `MathClass`, and whether it is a big operator that takes limits |
| `MathText` | `\text` content or an operator name such as `sin` or `lim`, with its class and whether it takes limits |
| `MathScripts` | a nucleus with a superscript, a subscript, or both |
| `MathFraction` | numerator, denominator, and the style `\dfrac` or `\tfrac` forces |
| `MathRadical` | the body and an optional degree |
| `MathDelimited` | `\left` and `\right` delimiters around a body; `\0` is the empty `.` delimiter |
| `MathAccent` | an accent character, or a bar, over a body |
| `MathSpace` | a fixed space in em |
| `MathError` | the source of a formula that could not be read |

## Methods

### `Parse` *(static)*
	parse a list until the end of the source
	if anything failed along the way
		return a MathError holding the source
	return the list

### Parsing a list
	repeat
		skip whitespace
		at the end: fine only for the whole formula
		`}` closes a group, `]` closes a root's degree, `\right` ends a `\left` body
		otherwise parse one atom with its scripts and add it

### Parsing an atom with scripts
	parse the atom; a bare `^` or `_` has an empty nucleus
	while the next character is `^` or `_`
		a second superscript or second subscript fails the formula
		parse its argument: a `{…}` group, one command, or one character
	wrap in MathScripts when any script was read

### Choosing a face
	inside `\mathbf`: bold
	outside `\mathrm`, `\mathbf` and `\mathbb`: Latin letters and lowercase Greek are italic
	everything else: regular
