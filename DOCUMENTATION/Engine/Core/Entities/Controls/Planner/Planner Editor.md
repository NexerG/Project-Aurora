## Description

One open planner in a tab: a toolbar over either a Gantt chart, a board or a calendar of the same tickets, the `PlannerDocument` they show, and the file it came from. A planner is a `*.planner.xml` file in the vault, opened from the browser like a note or a sheet, and made with "New planner" in the File, vault and folder menus.

A planner holds categories and the tickets filed under them. A ticket has a name, a category, an optional colour of its own, a time range, a creator and a list of assignees. A ticket without a colour takes its category's colour, and a ticket whose category is missing is shown under the first category.

The Gantt view has a row per category, shaded, with its tickets under it, and a bar per ticket across a date header. It zooms between Hour, Day, Week and Month, and draws a line at the current time. The board view has a column per category and a card per ticket. Both are edited as described under Editing; cards on the board are dragged between and within columns. Categories can be added, renamed, recoloured and deleted, and board cards show the initials of their assignees as chips.

The calendar view lays the same tickets on a time grid, a Day or a Week at a time, or on a Month grid, and is edited by dragging blocks. A ticket can also carry attachments, time reserved before or after it such as travel or preparation, and can follow another ticket so that it moves with it.

Only the rows and date units inside the viewport have controls. The chart keeps a pool of parts and rebinds them to whatever is in view, the way the sheet grid does, with the name column pinned to the left and the date header pinned to the top.

A ticket's time is a `TimeRange`: a wall-clock start and an exclusive end, either all-day (midnight to midnight) or timed. A time zone name can be stored with it and is written back unchanged, but no conversion is made.

The creator of a ticket is a `User`, from `ArctisAurora.Core.Users`. There are no accounts: the current user is set by hand to "Grexen". A user is stored by name, and two users with the same name are equal.

## File format

```xml
<Planner Name="Launch">
	<Category Id="…" Name="Design" Color="#4C8BF5"/>
	<Ticket Id="…" Name="Mockups" Category="…" Start="2026-10-07" End="2026-10-10" AllDay="true" Creator="Grexen" Created="2026-10-07T09:30:00" Order="0" Follows="…">
		<Assignee User="Grexen"/>
		<Attachment Kind="Travel" Side="Before" Minutes="30"/>
	</Ticket>
</Planner>
```

All-day times are written `yyyy-MM-dd`, timed ones `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm`. A planner with no category gets one called "General" when it is read. A ticket without a readable start and end is kept as an unknown element and written back unchanged, as is any other element the reader does not know. Categories are written first, then tickets, then the unknown elements. A ticket's `Follows` attribute names the ticket it follows and is written after `Order`. An `Attachment` element holds a kind, a side (`Before` or `After`) and a number of minutes, and is written after the assignees; one without a kind or without positive minutes is kept as an unknown element.

## Editing

Click a bar on the Gantt chart to select it; the selected bar is outlined in Ink. Drag the middle of a bar to move it, or drag near an edge to resize it. The edge zone is the smaller of 6 pixels and a third of the bar inside the bar, and 6 pixels outside it; over an edge the cursor becomes a horizontal resize. A drag snaps by the delta rather than by the edge: to the hour on Hour zoom for a timed ticket, to the day otherwise, so a timed ticket moved on Day zoom keeps its time of day. A resize keeps at least one unit. A whole drag is one undo step, "Move ticket" or "Resize ticket". Double-click a bar to edit it.

"+ Ticket" in the toolbar opens the ticket popup for a new ticket. The new ticket is called "New ticket", lasts today as an all-day ticket, is created by the current user, and goes last in the selected ticket's category, or in the first category when nothing is selected. Delete removes the selected ticket. Ctrl+Z undoes, Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z redoes, and Ctrl+S saves.

The ticket popup has a name box, a category dropdown, start and end boxes, an assignees box, a colour picker, the creator ("Created by") and an Apply button. Dates are `yyyy-MM-dd` for an all-day ticket, with the end shown as the last day, and `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` for a timed one; two dates make the ticket all-day, and a time in either box makes it timed. A box that cannot be read keeps its value, and an end at or before the start becomes one day or one hour after it. Assignees are comma-separated names. Enter in any box or Apply applies all fields as one undo step; Esc or a click outside cancels. Changing the category puts the ticket last in the new one. The category list opens over the popup without closing it. There is no Tab between the boxes yet.

Right-click a bar for the planner menu: Edit ticket, Delete ticket and a Move to category submenu that lists the planner's categories when it opens, so it is never stale. The right click selects the ticket in the row first.

Press a card on the board and move it 4 pixels to start dragging it; a preview of the card follows the pointer, as a dragged tab does. While the pointer is over the board the column it would drop into is outlined in Accent, and a gap opens where the card will land: above the card the drop lands before, or below the last card when it lands last. The column is the one whose horizontal range holds the pointer, otherwise the nearest, and the place is after the column's other cards whose centre is above the pointer. Dropping files the ticket under that column's category at that place and renumbers the column's `order`, as one undo step, "Move ticket". The source column is not renumbered, so its `order` may keep a gap. Dropping outside the board does nothing. Cards cannot be selected or opened from the board yet. The board is rebuilt one tick after any change, not during the click or drag that caused it, so a change shows on the board one tick late.

The editor reads "now" from a clock, which is the system time unless a test pins it; the today line and the chart span follow it.

## Categories

"+ Category" in the toolbar opens the category popup for a new category, which starts with the planner's default colour and goes last. Double-click a category row on the Gantt chart or a column on the board to edit that category. Right-click either and choose "Edit category" or "Add category"; Edit acts on the category last pressed on, a right press included, so the menu needs no target of its own. Each change is one undo step: "Add category", "Edit category" or "Delete category".

The popup has a name box, a colour picker and an Apply button, and a Delete button when a category is being edited and the planner has more than one. Enter or Apply applies. An empty name keeps the old name, or becomes "New category" for a new category. Esc or a click outside cancels.

Deleting a category leaves its tickets pointing at it. They are shown under the first category while it is gone, and one undo brings the category back with its tickets in place. The saved file still names the deleted category on those tickets, and on load they fall back to the first category. The last category cannot be deleted. The order of categories cannot be changed yet, and two categories with the same name resolve to the first in the ticket popup's dropdown.

## Calendar

The toolbar's "Calendar" button shows the calendar. Its Day, Week and Month buttons choose the span, and `<`, `Today` and `>` step the shown period by a day, a week or a month; the zoom buttons belong to the Gantt chart only. Week is the default span. The calendar opens scrolled to 07:00, and Day or Week reopens at 07:00 after Month.

Day and Week show a time grid. The hours are pinned to the left, and the day names and an all-day strip are pinned to the top. The strip holds all-day tickets and timed tickets of 24 hours or more, packed into lanes. A timed ticket that crosses midnight is drawn as one block per day. A line with a dot marks the current time across today's column, and it moves once a minute so an idle window stays idle. A Week starts on the anchor's Monday.

Month shows a grid of 6 weeks, starting on the Monday on or before the 1st. Each cell has its day number, in Accent for today and muted outside the month, and a chip per ticket, "HH:mm Name" or just the name for an all-day or long ticket. A full cell ends with "+N more".

Tickets that overlap in time are packed side by side: they are sorted by start, then longest first, split into clusters of tickets that overlap directly or through others, and each is given the first column that is free. The all-day strip packs its lanes the same way. Packing uses a ticket's time including its attachments.

Click a block to select it; it is outlined in Ink. On Day and Week, drag the middle of a timed block to move it, also to another day, or drag its top or bottom edge to resize it; the cursor becomes a vertical resize over an edge. A drag snaps to 15 minutes and a resize keeps at least one snap. A block in the all-day strip or a Month chip moves by whole days and cannot be resized. Releasing records the change as one undo step.

Double-click a block to edit it. Double-click an empty slot of the time grid for a new ticket of one hour, starting at the slot floored to 15 minutes. Double-click the strip or a Month cell for a new all-day ticket. Right-click opens the planner menu. The calendar is as wide as the viewport and does not scroll sideways.

## Attachments and links

An attachment is time reserved before or after a ticket, of a kind. The kinds are data: the engine ships Travel (30 minutes by default) and Prep (15 minutes), each with a colour, and a host may add its own in an optional file; a kind with the same name as an earlier one replaces it. On the Gantt chart an attachment is a translucent block in the kind's colour beside the bar, in the same row. On the calendar the Day and Week views draw them the same way. The board, Month chips and the all-day strip do not show them yet. A ticket's outer time is its time including its attachments, and the Gantt span and the calendar packing use it.

The ticket popup has a "Before" and an "After" row. An attachment is written as a kind and a length, separated by commas: "Travel 30m, Prep 1h". `1h30` means 90 minutes, a bare number means minutes, no length takes the kind's default, and an unknown kind is dropped.

A ticket can follow one other ticket, chosen in the popup's "Follows" dropdown, which lists every ticket except the ticket itself and those downstream of it, so a cycle cannot be made. Several tickets may follow the same one. When a ticket's end changes, every ticket downstream of it moves by the same amount, in the same undo step. Moving a ticket changes its end; resizing only its start does not; an edit in the popup that moves the end does. Followers jump when the drag is released, not while it is dragged. The Gantt chart draws a link from the leader's end, down or up to the follower's row, and across to its start.

## Views and zoom

The zoom sets how wide a day is: 768 pixels at Hour, 32 at Day, 10 at Week and 3 at Month. The chart spans every ticket and today, padded by 4 units, or 6 at Hour. The date header has two bands: the upper band shows days, months or years, and the lower band shows the zoom unit. Weeks start on Monday. Changing the zoom keeps the time at the left edge of the viewport where it was.

A board card has a colour strip across its top, then the name, the dates and "by" the creator. When the ticket has assignees, a row of chips follows, one per assignee, showing their initials: the first letters of the first two words of the name, or the first two letters of a one-word name, in capitals, so "Ada Lovelace" is "AL" and "Grexen" is "GR"; an empty name shows "?". A column's heading is its swatch, the category name and the ticket count. The tickets of a column are in `order`, then by start.

The view, zoom and scroll are kept with the session, so a restored tab opens where it was left. On the calendar the span and the anchor day are kept too, with today meaning today when the tab is restored.
